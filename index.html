                <p>For those with dietary restrictions, choosing where to go to college can be difficult. It isn't always easy to find a college or university that can accommodate dietary needs, and navigating dining halls can pose a unique set of challenges. Even when needs are met, it can be difficult to sustain a social life, as food remains at the heart of most interactions.</p>
                
                <p> Whether you're a high school senior trying to find out where to apply or a college student seeking tips on being safe and maintaining a social life with a food allergy, keep scrolling to hear from Hannah, Jennie, Emmy, Natalie and Mallika. </p>

                <h2>Hannah's Story</h2>
                <p>Hannah, a recent graduate from Boston University, encountered an array of challenges at the dining halls with an anaphylactic reaction to tree nuts and allergies to soy and sesame.</p>
                
                <p> When Hannah committed to Boston University, she was not very concerned about her nut allergy as the university is largely nut-free. However, after her mom suggested she speak with the school's dietitian, Hannah found out that Boston University cooks 90 percent of their meals in a cost-effective oil that contains soy, leaving her with few options outside of the salad bar (she had to bring her own dressings). In order to receive a meal that accommodated her needs, Hannah would have to order her meals three hours in advance, often precluding her from eating with her friends. After her freshman year, Hannah moved off campus, so she could cook her own meals.  </p>
                
                <p> While the move proved beneficial, Hannah still found that her dietary needs kept her out of many social interactions on campus. But, she would often invite friends to go grocery shopping with her to pick out ingredients friendly to everyone. They would then return to her apartment to cook and play games.</p>
                 
                 <p> Looking back, Hannah said that while she loved Boston University, she wishes she had considered her dietary needs more when applying to colleges and choosing where to attend. She also recommends those with dietary needs take time to choose roommates who are supportive, maintain separate cookware and be open about what foods cannot enter shared space.  </p>

                <h2>Emmy's Story</h2>
                
                <p>Emmy is a student at Brigham Young University (BYU) and has a moderate to severe reaction to eating gluten, a protein found in many grains including wheat, barley and rye. </p>
                
                <p> Emmy did not heavily consider her dietary needs when choosing BYU as it was her best option both financially and academically. She lived on campus her freshman year and ate at the dining halls, which she found to have limited options that were healthy and substantive. Emmy added that as an athlete and dancer, she had to fuel her body with as many calories as possible.  </p>
                
                <p> "Overall, the food I was eating wasnâ€™t giving my body the nutrients it needed," Emmy said. "I ended up with gout (very uncommon for someone my age) because of my dietary 'choices.'"</p>
                
                <p> Many of Emmy's friends also misunderstood her needs, claiming she had chosen to be gluten free in an attempt to lose weight. But some of her other friends were very understanding and made her feel more "at home and included." </p>
                
                
                <p> "Eating right will change your entire college experience," Emmy said. You will feel more energized and ready to handle a heavy work load."</p>

                <h2>Mallika's story</h2>
                
                <p>"I was diagnosed with Celiac Disease when I was 16 years old. It's actually a pretty misunderstood condition, as it's an auto-immune disease as opposed to being an allergy. For someone with Celiac Disease, eating even a trace of gluten can lead to severe intestinal damage that takes over a month to heal and a week to recover from symptomatically. In addition to having Celiac, I am also vegetarian and lactose intolerant." </p>
                
                <p>"When I was looking at colleges and deciding where to apply, I paid a lot of attention to finding a place where I could eat without risk. And, after I had received my acceptances, I took the time to speak with university's dietitians to get a better sense of what they could provide." </p>
                
                <p>"In some ways, the dining halls did a good job of accommodating my needs in that I was able to use the BearFit allergen friendly station. But in other ways, it was really tough as BearFit was often closed, leaving me with hardly any safe options. There were also times where I found wheat-rich food to be falsely labeled as gluten free, which was definitely scary and added to the fears associated with eating on campus."</p>
                
                <p>"I was lucky about maintaining a social life my freshman year as food is so central to interactions. I was very fortunate to find a group of wonderful, understanding friends. We even live together now off campus! And when I am not hanging out with them, I either eat beforehand or bring food along with me to social events. While taking those steps are sometimes a hassle, it is really worthwhile in the end!" </p>
